# PC Engines apu coreboot Open Source Firmware v4.9.0.2

## Key changes

Mainline:

1. **Enabled** Core Peformance Boost feature. For details how it works and how
   to verify it really works, please refer to [this blog post](https://3mdeb.com/firmware/amd-cpu-boost/)
2. **Corrected AGESA headers**, which were for newer AGESA version than used in
   coreboot.
3. [Reproducible builds limiation](https://github.com/pcengines/coreboot/issues/267) -
   currently set **iPXE** and **Memtest86**+ master revisions do not guarantee
   the build reproducibility in long term. Correct revisions will be set in
   **v4.9.0.3**.
4. Performed an **analysis** how to **safely reboot** platform after firmware
   upgrade using available reset methods:
   https://github.com/pcengines/apu2-documentation/pull/131
   https://github.com/pcengines/apu2-documentation/pull/108
5. pcengines.github.io page has been **updated** with **newsletter**
   **subscription** option and a **blog** with release reports containing key
   changes, test statistics/charts etc.

The chart shows the total files changed from release tag against the rebase point of given release specified in CHANGELOG (CHANGELOG.md and gitlab-ci.yml excluded from statistics). Check the statistics with:

```
git diff --stat <rebase_point_sha> ':(exclude)gitlab-ci.yml' ':(exclude)CHANGELOG.md'
```

The chart represents the total line added and deleted on the PC Engines
coreboot fork against the rebase point for given release. Check the statistics
with:

git diff --stat <rebase_point_sha> ':(exclude)gitlab-ci.yml' ':(exclude)CHANGELOG.md'
```

Two files have not been included in the diff as mentioned above since they are
not a part of coreboot tree. The difference has grown a little since some
patches have not yet been merged and/or sent (AGESA headers).

We have updated some tests results after re-testing, therefore some statistics
may not match with the information from the previous newsletter.

* Mainline:
  * PASSED: 306 (+12)
  * FAILED: 16 (-2)
  * PASSED [%]: 95,03% (+0.8%)
* Legacy:
  * PASSED: 282 (+10)
  * FAILED: 15 (0)
  * PASSED [%]: 94,95% (+0.18%)

The increase in the number of PASSED tests results from new tests (+8) and
resolved issue #219. Legacy tests have been updated to skip XEN tests. The
number of FAILED tests is the aggregated amount of issues listed in the table
below that happened during regression testing.
